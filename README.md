# 📁 cv-14day-computer-vision

A 14-day practical learning journey into Computer Vision, built for beginners using OpenCV, MediaPipe, YOLOv5, and SAM.

## 🧠 Who is this for?
- Total beginners interested in Computer Vision
- Creators who want to make cool AI effects
- Developers looking for a step-by-step vision crash course

## 🧰 Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(You can also run everything in **Paperspace Notebooks** with a free GPU like P5000.)

## 📅 Daily Learning Plan
Each day contains a single `.ipynb` file with code + tasks:

| Day | Topic | Description |

| 02  | Image Filters | Blur, edge detection, grayscale, thresholding |
| 03  | Webcam Draw | Capture webcam, draw on frame, overlay text |
| 04  | Transparent Effects | Add overlays, stickers, channel blending |
| 05  | MediaPipe Hands | Detect hands + 21 keypoints in real-time |
| 06  | Pose Detection | MediaPipe full-body pose tracking 🔥 |
| 07  | Face & Emotion | Detect faces, simple expression estimation |
| 08  | YOLOv5 Inference | Object detection with pretrained YOLOv5 |
| 09  | YOLOv5 Training | Train custom detector (optional dataset needed) |
| 10  | Segmentation Basics | What is segmentation? Why it matters |
| 11  | Meta SAM | Use Segment Anything Model to cut things out 🔥 |
| 12  | Style Transfer | Neural style transfer or cartoonization |
| 13  | Project: Hand Music Controller | Play music with hand signs 🎵 |
| 14  | Project: BG Replace with SAM | AI cutout & background switch |
